## Key Insights

### Critical Findings

1. **High-Risk Categories:**
   - Online shopping (shopping_net): 506 fraud cases
   - Point-of-sale grocery (grocery_pos): 485 fraud cases
   - Miscellaneous online (misc_net): 267 fraud cases

2. **Temporal Patterns:**
   - Fraud activity shows irregular spikes throughout the analysis period
   - Peak fraud periods align with high shopping seasons

3. **Geographic Distribution:**
   - Fraud incidents distributed across multiple regions
   - Concentration patterns suggest both localized and distributed fraud networks
